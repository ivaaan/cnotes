# CNotes: a note-taking app for team calls.

CNotes ("call notes") syncs with Google Calendar and creates a multi-user note-taking page that allows everyone who's on the call to edit it. The page has the following sections: Google Calendar (to click on events and see notes for each event), call agenda, to-do list, text notes, possibly drawing pad or flowcharts, etc.

## MVP

Users should be able to log into the app via their Google account, see the events for that day, click on any event and see the call notes. If there's more than one user in the current note, all users should see the moving cursors and messages like "someone is typing".
